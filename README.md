# E-Commerce System  

This project is a simple **E-Commerce System** developed in **Java** using **Gradle**.  

## **Problem Statement**  
A college student with a group of friends enjoys purchasing products tailored to each person's needs. They frequently use an **e-commerce platform** that offers a wide range of transactions. Could you assist them in **calculating their total expenditure on purchases**? A **5% GST** gets added to the total worth of products.  

 **Notes:**  
- Handle **exceptions gracefully**.  
- Write **clean, modular, and scalable** code.
